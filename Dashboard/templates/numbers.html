            <p class="number-desc">Numbers 1-5
                Signing numbers 1-5 is similar to how you would naturally count on your fingers. For most situations, face your palm toward you with the back of your hand facing outward.[2] However, if you’re signing a multiple-digit number or series of numbers, like a phone number, face your palm outwards.[3]
                
                    1: Point upward with your index finger, keep the rest of your fingers in a fist or ASL “S”-shape.
                    2: Point upward with your index and middle fingers.
                    3: Same as signing the number 2, but with your thumb extended.
                    4: Hold up all fingers except your thumb.
                    5: Hold up all five fingers</p>

                Numbers 6-9
                The numbers 6-9 are counted by touching a different finger to your thumb for each digit. Face your palm outwards, towards the person to whom you are signing. The order is pinkie to thumb (6), then ring finger (7), middle finger (8), index (9). If you forget which way this goes, it might be helpful to remember that for the smallest number (6) you touch your thumb to the smallest finger (pinkie).[4]
                
                    6: From a 5 handshape, touch your pinky to your thumb.
                    7: From a 5 handshape, touch your ring finger to your thumb.
                    8: From a 5 handshape, touch your middle finger to your thumb.
                    9: From a 5 handshape, touch your index finger to your thumb.

                Numbers 11-15
                Face your palm towards you to sign numbers 11-15. Numbers 11-12 require you to “flick” your fingers upward and outward from your palm. For numbers 13-15, bend your fingers toward you in more of a “come here” gesture.[6]
                
                    11: From a loose fist, flick your index finger twice against your thumb.
                    12: From a loose fist, flick your index and middle fingers twice against your thumb.
                    13: Extend your thumb, index, and middle fingers. Bend your index and middle fingers twice toward you.

                Numbers 16-19
                For each number, your hand takes the shape of the base number, e.g. “6” for “16” and “8” for “18.” Start with your palm facing inward and twist your wrist as if you were going to turn the sign to face outward. Instead, stop about halfway through the turn, twist your hand back toward you, and repeat.[7]
                
                    16: Touch your pinky to your thumb. Face your palm toward you then twist it outward twice.
                    17: Touch your ring finger to your thumb. Face your palm toward you then twist it outward twice.
                    18: Touch your middle finger to your thumb. Face your palm toward you then twist it outward twice.

                To sign the number 20, face your palm forward and tap your thumb and index finger together twice. Curl all other fingers into your palm. This gesture is similar to how you would pinch something, or if you were making the “G” sign but opening and closing your fingers.</p>

                    If you sign right-handed, move your second “2” toward the right. If you sign left-handed, move it toward the left.
